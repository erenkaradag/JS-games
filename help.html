    <p>Stellar is a game that was built for raising children's awareness for the efforts put into space exploration, in hopes that a new generation of children would be inspired to learn more about space.</p>
    <p>I was inspired to make this game for you, mainly inspired from NASA's journey to expand their travels further than before</p>
    <p>Apollo missions were various objectives, all set towards focusing on our moon. Apollo 11 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon. This inspired me to make Stellar for you.</p>
    <p>Here is an image of Apollo 11's landing on the moon:</p>
